# Elements code tutorial

## Using Elements to perform basic operations

With both Elements daemons running we can now use the associated client to get wallet information for them both:

~~~~
e1-cli getwalletinfo
e2-cli getwalletinfo
~~~~

You will see that we currently have 21 million "bitcoin" in each wallet, which anyone can spend (the outputs are anyone-can-spend, OP_TRUE), which is useful for testing. The amount of the default asset created can be changed using the "initialfreecoins" setting in the elements config file. The fact that the asset is named bitcoin can be ignored for now - it is merely a label assigned to the default asset in Elements. We will see how to change this later when we issue our own asset and how to drain the wallet amounts in a moment.

##### NOTE: You may notice that a lot of the RPC commands you can issue to an Elements client are the same as those you can issue to a Bitcoin client. This is because the Elements code is based upon Bitcoin's own. You can find a list of the available RPC commands for the Elements client [here](https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements/blob/f87a264075841666986212612b96fba54a26a826/src/rpc/client.cpp). 

Let's drain the OP_TRUE values and send half the assets to a new address generated by each Elements node. We'll also need to generate more than 100 blocks so that the coins are spendable (a requirement of the maturity rule for spending coinbase rewards):

~~~~
e1-cli sendtoaddress $(e1-cli getnewaddress) 21000000 "" "" true
e1-cli generate 101
e1-cli sendtoaddress $(e2-cli getnewaddress) 10500000 "" "" false
e1-cli generate 101
~~~~

Now check that the funds have been evenly split:

~~~~
e1-cli getwalletinfo
e2-cli getwalletinfo
~~~~

Both should show (amongst other values):

<div class="console-output">"bitcoin": 10500000.00000000</div>
