calculateasset "txid" vout ( "asset_entropy" blind_reissuance )

Calculate the asset tags and reissuance asset tags for a given prevout and contract hash

Arguments:
1. txid                (string, required) Transaction id of the output that will be spent for this issuance.
2. vout                (numeric, required) Output index of the output that will be spent for this issuance.
3. asset_entropy       (string) Additional asset entropy to be included in the asset tag. This is the contract hash.
4. blind_reissuance    (boolean, optional, default=true) Whether the reissuance asset tag will be blinded

Result:
{                                    (json object)
  "asset_tag" : "hex",               (string) Calculated asset tag.
  "reissuance_asset_tag" : "hex",    (string) Asset tag for the reissuance tokens.
  "final_asset_entropy" : "hex"      (string) The calculated asset entropy that is needed for reissuance.
