Examples:

Send two amounts to two different addresses:
> elements-cli sendmany "" "{\"bc1q09vm5lfy0j5reeulh4x5752q25uqqvz34hufdl\":0.01,\"bc1q02ad21edsxd23d32dfgqqsz4vv4nmtfzuklhy3\":0.02}"

Send two amounts to two different addresses setting the confirmation and comment:
> elements-cli sendmany "" "{\"bc1q09vm5lfy0j5reeulh4x5752q25uqqvz34hufdl\":0.01,\"bc1q02ad21edsxd23d32dfgqqsz4vv4nmtfzuklhy3\":0.02}" 6 "testing"

Send two amounts to two different addresses, subtract fee from amount:
> elements-cli sendmany "" "{\"bc1q09vm5lfy0j5reeulh4x5752q25uqqvz34hufdl\":0.01,\"bc1q02ad21edsxd23d32dfgqqsz4vv4nmtfzuklhy3\":0.02}" 1 "" "[\"bc1q09vm5lfy0j5reeulh4x5752q25uqqvz34hufdl\",\"bc1q02ad21edsxd23d32dfgqqsz4vv4nmtfzuklhy3\"]"
