getblockheader "blockhash" ( verbose )

If verbose is false, returns a string that is serialized, hex-encoded data for blockheader 'hash'.
If verbose is true, returns an Object with information about blockheader <hash>.

Arguments:
1. blockhash    (string, required) The block hash
2. verbose      (boolean, optional, default=true) true for a json object, false for the hex-encoded data

Result (for verbose = true):
{                                     (json object)
  "hash" : "hex",                     (string) the block hash (same as provided)
  "confirmations" : n,                (numeric) The number of confirmations, or -1 if the block is not on the main chain
  "height" : n,                       (numeric) The block height or index
  "version" : n,                      (numeric) The block version
  "versionHex" : "hex",               (string) The block version formatted in hexadecimal
  "merkleroot" : "hex",               (string) The merkle root
  "time" : xxx,                       (numeric) The block time expressed in UNIX epoch time
  "mediantime" : xxx,                 (numeric) The median block time expressed in UNIX epoch time
  "nonce" : n,                        (numeric) The nonce
  "bits" : "hex",                     (string) The bits
  "difficulty" : n,                   (numeric) The difficulty
  "chainwork" : "hex",                (string) Expected number of hashes required to produce the current chain
  "nTx" : n,                          (numeric) The number of transactions in the block
  "signblock_witness_asm" : "str",    (string) ASM of sign block witness data
  "signblock_witness_hex" : "hex",    (string) Hex of sign block witness data
  "dynamic_parameters" : {            (json object) Dynamic federation parameters in the block, if any
    "current" : {                     (json object) enforced dynamic federation parameters. The signblockscript is published for each block, while others are published only at epoch start
      "signblockscript" : "hex",      (string) signblock script
      "max_block_witness" : n,        (numeric) Maximum serialized size of the block witness stack
      "fedpegscript" : "hex",         (string) fedpeg script
      "extension_space" : [           (json array) array of hex-encoded strings
        ...
      ]
    },
    "proposed" : {                    (json object) Proposed parameters. Uninforced. Must be published in full
      ...                             same entries as current
    }
  },
  "previousblockhash" : "hex",        (string, optional) The hash of the previous block (if available)
  "nextblockhash" : "hex"             (string, optional) The hash of the next block (if available)
}

Result (for verbose=false):
"hex"    (string) A string that is serialized, hex-encoded data for block 'hash'
