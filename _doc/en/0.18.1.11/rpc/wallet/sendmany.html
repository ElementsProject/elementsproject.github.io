sendmany "" {"address":amount} ( minconf "comment" ["address",...] replaceable conf_target "estimate_mode" {"address":"str"} ignoreblindfail )

Send multiple times. Amounts are double-precision floating point numbers.

Arguments:
1. dummy                     (string, required) Must be set to "" for backwards compatibility.
2. amounts                   (json object, required) A json object with addresses and amounts
     {
       "address": amount,    (numeric or string, required) The address is the key, the numeric amount (can be string) in BTC is the value
     }
3. minconf                   (numeric, optional, default=1) Only use the balance confirmed at least this many times.
4. comment                   (string, optional) A comment
5. subtractfeefrom           (json array, optional) A json array with addresses.
                             The fee will be equally deducted from the amount of each selected address.
                             Those recipients will receive less bitcoins than you enter in their corresponding amount field.
                             If no addresses are specified here, the sender pays the fee.
     [
       "address",            (string) Subtract fee from this address
       ...
     ]
6. replaceable               (boolean, optional, default=wallet default) Allow this transaction to be replaced by a transaction with higher fees via BIP 125
7. conf_target               (numeric, optional, default=wallet default) Confirmation target (in blocks)
8. estimate_mode             (string, optional, default=UNSET) The fee estimate mode, must be one of:
                             "UNSET"
                             "ECONOMICAL"
                             "CONSERVATIVE"
9. output_assets             (json object) A json object of addresses to assets.
     {
       "address": "str",     (string, required) A key-value pair where the key is the address used and the value is an asset label or hex asset ID.
     }
10. ignoreblindfail          (boolean, optional, default=true) Return a transaction even when a blinding attempt fails due to number of blinded inputs/outputs.

Result:
"txid"                   (string) The transaction id for the send. Only 1 transaction is created regardless of 
                                    the number of addresses.

Examples:

Send two amounts to two different addresses:
> elements-cli sendmany "" "{\"1D1ZrZNe3JUo7ZycKEYQQiQAWd9y54F4XX\":0.01,\"1353tsE8YMTA4EuV7dgUXGjNFf9KpVvKHz\":0.02}"

Send two amounts to two different addresses setting the confirmation and comment:
> elements-cli sendmany "" "{\"1D1ZrZNe3JUo7ZycKEYQQiQAWd9y54F4XX\":0.01,\"1353tsE8YMTA4EuV7dgUXGjNFf9KpVvKHz\":0.02}" 6 "testing"

Send two amounts to two different addresses, subtract fee from amount:
> elements-cli sendmany "" "{\"1D1ZrZNe3JUo7ZycKEYQQiQAWd9y54F4XX\":0.01,\"1353tsE8YMTA4EuV7dgUXGjNFf9KpVvKHz\":0.02}" 1 "" "[\"1D1ZrZNe3JUo7ZycKEYQQiQAWd9y54F4XX\",\"1353tsE8YMTA4EuV7dgUXGjNFf9KpVvKHz\"]"
