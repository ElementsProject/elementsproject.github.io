getsidechaininfo
Returns an object containing various state info regarding sidechain functionality.

Result:
{                                                (json object)
  "fedpegscript" : "hex",                        (string) The fedpegscript from genesis block
  "current_fedpegscripts" : [                    (json array) The currently-enforced fedpegscripts in hex. Peg-ins for any entries on this list are honored by consensus and policy. Oldest first. Two total entries are possible
    "hex",                                       (string) active fedpegscript
    ...
  ],
  "current_fedpeg_programs" : [                  (json array) The currently-enforced fedpegscript scriptPubKeys in hex. Prior to a transition this may be P2SH scriptpubkey, otherwise it will be a native segwit script. Results are paired in-order with current_fedpegscripts
    "hex",                                       (string) active fedpegscript scriptPubKeys
    ...
  ],

  "min_peg_diff" : "str",                        (string) The minimum difficulty parent chain header target. Peg-in headers that have less work will be rejected as an anti-Dos measure
  "parent_blockhash" : "hex",                    (string) The parent genesis blockhash as source of pegged-in funds
  "parent_chain_has_pow" : true|false,           (boolean) Whether parent chain has pow or signed blocks
  "parent_chain_signblockscript_asm" : "str",    (string) If the parent chain has signed blocks, its signblockscript in ASM
  "parent_chain_signblockscript_hex" : "hex",    (string) If the parent chain has signed blocks, its signblockscript in hex
  "parent_pegged_asset" : "hex",                 (string) If the parent chain has Confidential Assets, the asset id of the pegged asset in that chain
  "pegin_confirmation_depth" : n,                (numeric) The number of mainchain confirmations required for a peg-in transaction to become valid
  "enforce_pak" : true|false                     (boolean) If peg-out authorization is being enforced
