Sign inputs for raw transaction (serialized, hex-encoded).
The second optional argument (may be null) is an array of previous transaction outputs that

Arguments:
1. hexstring                           (string, required) The transaction hex string
2. prevtxs                             (json array, optional) A json array of previous dependent transaction outputs
     [
       {                               (json object)
         "txid": "hex",                (string, required) The transaction id
         "vout": n,                    (numeric, required) The output number
         "scriptPubKey": "hex",        (string, required) script key
         "redeemScript": "hex",        (string) (required for P2SH) redeem script
         "witnessScript": "hex",       (string) (required for P2WSH or P2SH-P2WSH) witness script
         "amount": amount,             (numeric or string) The amount spent (required if non-confidential segwit output)
         "amountcommitment": "str",    (string) The amount commitment spent (required if confidential segwit output)
       },
       ...
     ]
3. sighashtype                         (string, optional, default=ALL) The signature hash type. Must be one of
                                       "ALL"
                                       "NONE"

  "complete" : true|false,          (boolean) If the transaction has a complete set of signatures
  "errors" : [                      (json array of objects) Script verification errors (if there are any)
    {
      "txid" : "hash",              (string) The hash of the referenced, previous transaction
      "vout" : n,                   (numeric) The index of the output to spent and used as input
      "scriptSig" : "hex",          (string) The hex-encoded signature script
      "sequence" : n,               (numeric) Script sequence number
      "error" : "text"              (string) Verification or signing error related to the input
    }
    ,...
  ]
  "warning" : "text"            (string) Warning that a peg-in input signed may be immature. This could mean lack of connectivity to or misconfiguration of the daemon.}
