issueasset assetamount tokenamount ( blind )

Create an asset. Must have funds in wallet to do so. Returns asset hex id.
For more fine-grained control such as non-empty contract-hashes to commit
to an issuance policy, see `rawissueasset` RPC call.

Arguments:
1. assetamount    (numeric or string, required) Amount of asset to generate. Note that the amount is BTC-like, with 8 decimal places.
2. tokenamount    (numeric or string, required) Amount of reissuance tokens to generate. Note that the amount is BTC-like, with 8 decimal places. These will allow you to reissue the asset if in wallet using `reissueasset`. These tokens are not consumed during reissuance.
3. blind          (boolean, optional, default=true) Whether to blind the issuances.

{                        (json object)
