reissueasset "asset" assetamount

Create more of an already issued asset. Must have reissuance token in wallet to do so. Reissuing does not affect your reissuance token balance, only asset.
For more fine-grained control such as reissuing from a multi-signature address cold wallet, see `rawreissueasset` RPC call.

Arguments:
1. asset          (string, required) The asset you want to re-issue. The corresponding token must be in your wallet.
2. assetamount    (numeric or string, required) Amount of additional asset to generate. Note that the amount is BTC-like, with 8 decimal places.

Result:
{                        (json object)
  "txid":"<txid>",   (string) Transaction id for issuance.
  "vin":"n",         (numeric) The input position of the issuance in the transaction.
}

Examples:
> elements-cli reissueasset <asset> 0
> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "reissueasset", "params": [<asset>, 0] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:7041/
