createrawtransaction [{"txid":"hex","vout":n,"sequence":n},...] [{"address":amount},{"data":"hex"},{"vdata":"hex"},{"burn":"hex"},{"fee":amount},...] ( locktime replaceable {"address":"str","fee":"str"} )

Create a transaction spending the given inputs and creating new outputs.
Outputs can be addresses or data.
Returns hex-encoded raw transaction.
Note that the transaction's inputs are not signed, and
it is not stored in the wallet or transmitted to the network.

Arguments:
1. inputs                      (json array, required) A json array of json objects
     [
       {                       (json object)
         "txid": "hex",        (string, required) The transaction id
         "vout": n,            (numeric, required) The output number
         "sequence": n,        (numeric, optional, default=depends on the value of the 'replaceable' and 'locktime' arguments) The sequence number
       },
       ...
     ]
2. outputs                     (json array, required) a json array with outputs (key-value pairs), where none of the keys are duplicated.
                               That is, each address can only appear once and there can only be one 'data' object.
                               For compatibility reasons, a dictionary, which holds the key-value pairs directly, is also
                               accepted as second parameter.
     [
       {                       (json object)
         "address": amount,    (numeric or string, required) A key-value pair. The key (string) is the bitcoin address, the value (float or string) is the amount in BTC
       },
       {                       (json object)
         "data": "hex",        (string, required) A key-value pair. The key must be "data", the value is hex-encoded data
       },
       {                       (json object)
         "vdata": "hex",       (string, required) The key is "vdata", the value is an array of hex encoded data
       },
       {                       (json object)
         "burn": "hex",        (string, required) A key-value pair. The key must be "burn", the value is the amount that will be burned.
       },
       {                       (json object)
         "fee": amount,        (numeric or string, required) The key is "fee", the value the fee output you want to add.
       },
       ...
     ]
3. locktime                    (numeric, optional, default=0) Raw locktime. Non-0 value also locktime-activates inputs
4. replaceable                 (boolean, optional, default=false) Marks this transaction as BIP125-replaceable.
                               Allows this transaction to be replaced by a transaction with higher fees. If provided, it is an error if explicit sequence numbers are incompatible.
5. output_assets               (json object) A json object of addresses to the assets (label or hex ID) used to pay them. (default: bitcoin)
     {
       "address": "str",       (string) A key-value pair. The key (string) is the bitcoin address, the value is the asset label or asset ID.
       "fee": "str",           (string) A key-value pair. The key (string) is the bitcoin address, the value is the asset label or asset ID.
     }

Result:
"transaction"              (string) hex string of the transaction
