rawblindrawtransaction "hexstring" ["inputamountblinder",...] [inputamount,...] ["inputasset",...] ["inputassetblinder",...] ( "totalblinder" ignoreblindfail )

Convert one or more outputs of a raw transaction into confidential ones.
Returns the hex-encoded raw transaction.
The input raw transaction cannot have already-blinded outputs.
The output keys used can be specified by using a confidential address in createrawtransaction.
If an additional blinded output is required to make a balanced blinding, a 0-value unspendable output will be added. Since there is no access to the wallet the blinding pubkey from the last output with blinding key will be repeated.
You can not blind issuances with this call.

Arguments:
1. hexstring                    (string, required) A hex-encoded raw transaction.
2. inputamountblinders          (json array, required) An array with one entry per transaction input.
     [
       "inputamountblinder",    (string, required) A hex-encoded blinding factor, one for each input.                           Blinding factors can be found in the "blinder" output of listunspent.
       ...
     ]
3. inputamounts                 (json array, required) An array with one entry per transaction input.
     [
       inputamount,             (numeric or string, required) An amount for each input.
       ...
     ]
4. inputassets                  (json array, required) An array with one entry per transaction input.
     [
       "inputasset",            (string, required) A hex-encoded asset id, one for each input.
       ...
     ]
5. inputassetblinders           (json array, required) An array with one entry per transaction input.
     [
       "inputassetblinder",     (string, required) A hex-encoded asset blinding factor, one for each input.
       ...
     ]
6. totalblinder                 (string, optional) Ignored for now.
7. ignoreblindfail              (boolean, optional, default=true) Return a transaction even when a blinding attempt fails due to number of blinded inputs/outputs.

Result:
"transaction"              (string) hex string of the transaction
