getblockheader "blockhash" ( verbose )

If verbose is false, returns a string that is serialized, hex-encoded data for blockheader 'hash'.
If verbose is true, returns an Object with information about blockheader <hash>.

Arguments:
1. blockhash    (string, required) The block hash
2. verbose      (boolean, optional, default=true) true for a json object, false for the hex-encoded data

Result (for verbose = true):
{
  "hash" : "hash",     (string) the block hash (same as provided)
  "confirmations" : n,   (numeric) The number of confirmations, or -1 if the block is not on the main chain
  "height" : n,          (numeric) The block height or index
  "version" : n,         (numeric) The block version
  "versionHex" : "00000000", (string) The block version formatted in hexadecimal
  "merkleroot" : "xxxx", (string) The merkle root
  "time" : ttt,          (numeric) The block time in seconds since epoch (Jan 1 1970 GMT)
  "mediantime" : ttt,    (numeric) The median block time in seconds since epoch (Jan 1 1970 GMT)
  "nonce" : n,           (numeric) The nonce
  "bits" : "1d00ffff", (string) The bits
  "difficulty" : x.xxx,  (numeric) The difficulty
  "chainwork" : "0000...1f3"     (string) Expected number of hashes required to produce the current chain (in hex)
  "nTx" : n,             (numeric) The number of transactions in the block.
  "signblock_witness_asm" : "xxxx", (string) ASM of sign block witness data.
  "signblock_witness_hex" : "xxxx", (string) Hex of sign block witness data.
  "dynamic_parameters" :           (obj) Dynamic federation parameters in the block, if any.
    {
        "current" :                (obj) enforced dynamic federation parameters. Do note that only the signblockscript is published for each block, while others are published only at epoch start.
            {
                "signblockscript" : "xxxx", (string) signblock script in hex
                "max_block_witness" : x, (numeric) Maximum serialized size of the block witness stack
                "fedpegscript" : "xxxx", (string) fedpegscript in hex
                "extension_space" :        (array) Array of hex-encoded strings
                    [

            }
        "proposed" :               (obj) Proposed paramaters. Uninforced. Must be published in full.
            {
                ...                  same entries as current
            }
    }
  "previousblockhash" : "hash",  (string) The hash of the previous block
  "nextblockhash" : "hash",      (string) The hash of the next block
}

Result (for verbose=false):
"data"             (string) A string that is serialized, hex-encoded data for block 'hash'.
