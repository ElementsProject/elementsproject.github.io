# An open source, sidechain-capable blockchain platform.

## Designing, building and operating your own private blockchain is easy with Elements.

Elements is an open source, sidechain-capable blockchain platform. Elements provides access to powerful features developed by members of the community, reducing internal development and research costs and enabling you to explore new applications of Blockchain and Sidechain technology.

Launched in June of 2015, Elements allows you to issue multiple different types of assets on a single blockchain, opening up many new use cases for implementation. An Elements based blockchain can operate as either a standalone Blockchain or be pegged to another and run as a Sidechain. Running Elements as a Sidechain enables assets to be verifiably transferred between two different blockchains. 

Built upon and extending Bitcoin's codebase, it lets developers familiar with the bitcoind API to quickly and cost-effectively create working blockchains and test proof-of-concept projects. This also allows Elements to function as a testbed for changes to the Bitcoin protocol itself. 

An example of an Elements based sidechain in production use is Blockstream's Liquid.

#### If you are developer, you might find it easier to start with the [Elements Code Tutorial]({{ site.url }}/elements-code-tutorial), which will explain the key features of Elements and show you how to use them.

### The features and benefits of using Elements

|Features|Benefits|
|--------|--------|
|    Asset Issuance - multiple types of asset can be issued and transferred between network participants.|    Secured by a federation of parties with aligned incentives.|
|    Confidential Transactions - transaction amount and asset type are private, known only to sender and receiver.|    Leverages the stability of the Bitcoin codebase, extending it with innovative new features.|
|    Flexible Configuration - Elements can operate as a standalone blockchain or as a sidechain, where assets are pegged to those on another blockchain.|    No risk of blockchain reorganisations - federated blocksigning provides rapid transaction finality.|
|    Schnorr Signatures - improved efficiency of transaction validation. New, compact multi-signature transactions.|    Advanced transaction privacy for both value and asset type transacted.|
|     Federated, two-way peg - allows assets to be transacted across different blockchains.|    Issue multiple different types of assets on a single blockchain, opening up many new use cases.|
|    Signed Blocks - block creation through multi-party signature retains decentralized properties while decreasing transaction confirmation times and preventing reorganisations.|    Public testnet and open source codebase lets you experiment with different security models and features created by other members of the community.|

### Elements extends Bitcoin's code and features

Extending and building upon Bitcoin's code allows developers familiar with the bitcoind API to quickly and cost effectively create working blockchains and test proof-of-concept projects. It also allows Elements to function as a test-bed for changes to the Bitcoin protocol itself. 

The Elements test network is called Elements Alpha and functions as a sidechain to Bitcoinâ€™s testnet. It serves as a technology demo and testing environment, making it easy for the community to jointly test the latest features being added to Elements. It also provides a way for developers to contribute their own Elements for community review, helping to improve and extend the Elements project and acting as a reliable way to test proposed changes to Bitcoin itself.

### Elements provides the following enhanced features
